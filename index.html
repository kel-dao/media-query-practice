    <h2>Is it really better?</h2>

    <p>	One of the first lessons we learned about front-end web development and styling was the importance of utilizing semantic elements such as “section” and “aside” when structuring our code. The importance was stressed for many reasons that we will dive deeper into. But to give a few immediate examples, sematic styling ultimately makes it easier for someone to navigate through your code when collaborating on a project and it also helps you, the developer, have cleaner visual cues on how to organize your content and nest containers within each other in a way that makes sense. 
      It’s important to know that sematic styling is made possible with HTML5. Before that, our container labels were mostly “divs” and “spans”, which without id’s, made it impossible to know what the content was about. With the use of semantic labels we are able to clearly identify what content we would expect to find within its container. For example, a “header” is generally where you would find the page title and possibly a navigation bar. It usually sits on the top of the page and lets the user know what website they’re on. You may also see a container for the “footer” which will be clear to the developer or the person looking over the code that the content there should be the last thing the user sees on the page and will typically include information about the website, who and how to contact administrative services for the page, and possibly terms and conditions or policies for the page. If you look at the image below, you’ll see how semantic styling can be very helpful to the developer as well as the user. It’s straight forward and clear how a page “should” be structured and depending on the type of page you’re developing, can eliminate the chore of having to organize content on your own. </p>

    <!-- img is max-width 100% of figure, which is 66% of article, which is 75% of container,
    which is 90% of viewport = figure is 44.55% width of viewport, and img is 100% of that or 638px,
    whichever is smaller
    - if viewport is 1433, img will be 638px (native width)
    - viewport 1122, img 500
    - viewport 673, img 300 

44.55 / 100 = 300 / x -->

    <p>However, one should not be fooled that semantic styling solves all problems! There are some semantic labels that can still act vague like divs.  Those would be labels such as “articles” and “sections”. The most helpful way of thinking about them would be to look at your old school newspaper. See below at the snippet of The Malverne Newspaper- you will notice that you are looking at a section of the newspaper and within the section there are different articles. Sometimes within articles, you will have different sections within them. Not to mention, they are interchangeable terms- the madness! </p>

    <p>So even though semantic styling seems to be a much easier way to organize your content, it’s not perfect. It can also be limiting. Maybe your content doesn’t necessarily fit the word-heavy layout that semantic styling works with best- maybe your content is mostly images or the content you want to present doesn’t fit into a section or article but just a plain old div? This was a challenge when going through our lessons in CSS and HTML5. The more practice we got with styling, the harder it was to stay semantic- to the point that we nixed most of the semantic labels altogether when coding. Even though seeing the layout be built semantically is much easier on the eyes, it didn’t allow us the fluidity and freedom of being able to use generic containers such as “div” and “span”. Adding classes and id’s to each div container also allowed the developer to become explicit as to what is to be expected. For example, you could want two div containers to look the same visually but the content within had special properties that you wanted to alter with CSS. Within your CSS code, all you would need to do is create changes to the div as a whole and then be more specific with styling edits using the specific class or id’s you labeled them as.</p>
